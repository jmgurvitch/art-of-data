Hello there! Lab 2 (the Animal Crossing lab) is an exercise in using APIs and Python classes to read and write data. I generated a csv file that I then analyzed with Python to answer the lab's questions.

## Making the dataset

When making the dataset, I initially thought that I would be best served by creating a class `Sock`, which was fairly straightforward. I soon discovered, however, that having such a class made the rest of the lab far less straightforward; anything that I could do with the class I could do with less code without it. Additionally, the data retrieved from the API was already in a form that could be easily inputted into a csv, so there was no reason to process it a bunch. I therefore did away with the class and focused on recreating the entire Animal Crossing spreadsheet in a csv file, `socks.csv`, that I could use to answer subsequent questions.

To retrieve data from the API, I identified the base url, endpoint, and key, all of which were necessary to access it at all. Once in contact with the API, I used a loop that requested API data starting at its 0th index--the first entry in the API--inputted it into a new row in `socks.csv` (with a special row for the header), and iterated upward in increments of 1 until it surpassed the maximum allowable index, at which point it had retrieved all of the data. 

Here's the whole function, where `BASE_URL = "http://hm-cs.herokuapp.com"`, `ENDPOINT = "/socks"`, and `API_KEY = "ArtOfDataKEY123"`:
```py
def make_csv(): #query the API for data and use that data to generate a CSV with relevant information
    with open("socks.csv", "w") as socks_csv:

        payload = {"key": API_KEY, "idx": 0} #variable index for iteration-capable payload
        response = requests.get(BASE_URL + ENDPOINT, params = payload)

        #iterate through the API's indices until we pass the maximum allowable index, at which we will receive an error code
        while response.ok:
            if payload["idx"] == 0:
                response_text = response.text[1:] #cut off first letter from only the first row
            else:
                response_text = response.text

            socks_csv.write(response_text + "\n") #every response comprises a new row in socks_csv
            payload["idx"] += 1 #increase index by one to access the next entry in the API data
            response = requests.get(BASE_URL + ENDPOINT, params = payload) #update response

```
This produces socks.csv, a csv of all of the data retrieved from the API. Here's its first few rows converted into a markdown table:

## Question 1
**Which sock has the most variations? If there is more than one answer, then list all of them.**

Having created `socks.csv` with the previous function, this question was a matter of figuring out the right combination of loops and conditionals to analyse the dataset. I initially had some trouble figuring out how to elegantly collect all of the socks with the maximum number of variations. I first planned to count up the number of instances of a certain sock and overwrite the previous one if the newly counted sock had a higher number of instances, but this did not work for two reasons. First, I didn't immediately realize that multiple socks could have the same number of variations (which was thecase for the maximum quantity of variations), meaning that I would have to store multiple sock types, not just overwrite the previous one. Second, I had not accounted for the scenario in which a single sock type had non-contiguous variations in the dataset. The dataset only has contiguous variations at present, but, to future-proof it, I wanted my code to be able to handle such a scenario. These concerns were largely solved by Feingold's wise suggestion to heavily adapt my penguins code, part of which fundamentally served the same purpose as this function. Using a dictionary whose key-value pairs were a sock type and its count made it very easy to find all of those socks which had the maximum number of variations, compile only those ones into a list, and then print that list.

Here's the whole function:
```py
def max_sock_variations():
    
    sock_variations_dict = {} #dictionary to store sock variations and their counts

    with open("socks.csv", "r") as socks_csv:
        
        data = csv.DictReader(socks_csv)
            
        #iterate through the "Name" column of socks.csv and count the number of instances--variations--of each sock type
        for row in data:
            if row["Name"] not in sock_variations_dict.keys(): #if new sock type
                sock_variations_dict[row["Name"]] = 1

            else: #if we've seen the sock type before
                sock_variations_dict[row["Name"]] += 1 #add one to count of that sock type
    
    #find highest number of variations by casting sock_variations_dict to a list
    max_variations = max(list(sock_variations_dict.values()))

    #make a list in which we will store all socks that have the max # of variations
    max_variations_list = []

    #iterate through each key-value pair. if a pair's value equals the max # of variations, then print its corresponding key
    for k, v in sock_variations_dict.items():
        if v == max_variations:
            max_variations_list.append(k)

    print("The following sock types have the maximum number of variations, which is " + str(max_variations) + " variations: " + str(max_variations_list))
```
This returns the following: 

`The following sock types have the maximum number of variations, which is 8 variations: ['argyle crew socks', 'color-blocked socks', 'frilly knee-high socks', 'holey tights', 'kiddie socks', 'mixed-tweed socks', 'no-show socks', 'semi-opaque socks', 'semi-opaque tights', 'sequin leggings', 'simple-accent socks', 'striped socks', 'striped tights', 'tube socks', 'ultra no-show socks', 'vivid leggings', 'vivid socks', 'vivid tights']`

## Question 2
**How many socks of each color are there? If a sock has two _different_ colors, it should be counted in both. _However_, if a sock has the same Color1 and Color2, make sure you donâ€™t double count it!**

Once I figured out the preceding function, this one was simply an adaptation of it with some extra conditionals thrown into the mix. My approach to handling both color 1 and color 2 was to first iterate through the "Color 1" column in `socks.csv` and record every color and its number of instances in the same manner that I did for variations above--that is, with a dictionary whose key-value pairs were a color and its count. After that, I iterated through the "Color 2" column, adding a color as a key if it was a new color or if it was not the same as the the "Color 1" entry in the same row (to avoid double counting). I then cast the dictionary to a list and printed it.

Here's the whole function:
```py
def num_sock_colors():
    
    sock_colors_dict = {} #dictionary to record sock colors and their counts
    
    with open("socks.csv", "r") as socks_csv:

        data = csv.DictReader(socks_csv)

        #iterate through the "Color 1" column and then the "Color 2" column of socks.csv and count the number of instances--variations--of each sock type
        for row in data:
            #color 1
            if row["Color 1"] not in sock_colors_dict.keys(): #if new sock color
                sock_colors_dict[row["Color 1"]] = 1
            else: #if we've seen the sock type before
                sock_colors_dict[row["Color 1"]] += 1 #add one to count of that sock type
            
            #color 2
            if row["Color 2"] not in sock_colors_dict.keys(): #if new sock color
                sock_colors_dict[row["Color 2"]] = 1
            elif row["Color 2"] != row["Color 1"]: #if we've seen the sock type before and the sock does not have the same color 1 and color 2
                sock_colors_dict[row["Color 2"]] += 1 #add one to count of that sock type

    print("Number of socks of each color: " + str(sock_colors_dict))
```
This returns the following: 

`Number of socks of each color: {'Pink': 41, 'Red': 39, 'Green': 50, 'Light blue': 33, 'Orange': 27, 'Purple': 37, 'Blue': 47, 'Yellow': 33, 'Beige': 15, 'White': 85, 'Black': 59, 'Brown': 11, 'Gray': 31, 'Colorful': 14}`.

# Reflections and notes on the code-writing process
Much like my experience with the previous lab, I began coding my answers to this lab's questions with a fairly narrow focus on Python classes. We had used them fairly frequently before the start of this lab, and I figured that any solution to the lab would have to hinge on classes. Furthermore, it was fairly easy to put the class `Sock` together, so I thought that I would just go with it. Here's what I had planned to use:

```
class Sock:
    def __init__(self, name, color1, color2): #we don't need to record variation because we can count the number of variations by counting the number of times that a sock type appears
        self.name = name
        self.color1 = color1
        self.color2 = color2

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name},{self.color1},{self.color2}
```

As I explained above, this was the wrong approach and not what I ended up using. Aside from using APIs, which was certainly a new experience, I completed a great deal of this lab by simply using the fundamentals: loops, conditionals, and modules such as csv.


In addition to bouncing ideas off of my classmates while in class every day, I worked closely with my classmate Jack Komaroff and with Bulyn Panjamapirom, a member of the G-period section of Art of Data.

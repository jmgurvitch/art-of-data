Hello there! Below I have detailed the splendid journey that was my completion of Lab 1.

## Question 1
**What is the average speed (Spd) of all Digimon?**
Having just finished a practice lab on nested dictionaries (the penguins one), I began the lab with the expectation that nested dictionaries would be central to every question. I tried to approach question 1 as such. While such a solution is possible, as I thought more about the question I realized that it could be solved much more simply (Occam's razor strikes again).

## Question 2
**Write a function that can count the number of Digimon with a specific attribute. For example, count_digimon("Type", "Vaccine") would return 70.**


## Question 3
**The Digimon on your team are restricted by the total amount of Memory that they need. If your team only has 15 Memory, name a team of up to 3 Digimon that has at least 300 attack (Atk) in total.**


Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes

**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

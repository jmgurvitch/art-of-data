Hello there! Lab 3 is an exercise in using, principally, pandas and seaborn to process, describe, and visualize data.

# The Datasets
After speaking with Feingold, they were kind enough to send me a Kaggle-hosted package of datasets compiled by FiveThirtyEight that underpins their story [The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/). (The data was originally collected by the U.S. Census Bureau.) As someone who spends quite a lot of time in the education sector myself, I was interested to examine various distributions of college majors and their outcomes. 

As it relates to data processing, the datasets all contain the same 173 majors. Those majors are, usefully, sorted into 16 categories. For example, "chemical engineering" and "nuclear engineering" both fall into the broader category of "engineering." This proved especially useful for visualization; in a bar graph, for example, it is vastly more readable to have 16 aggregate bars versus 173 individual bars. Another benefit of visualizing categories rather than majors was that I could keep a constant color code across most graphs to enable easier cross-comparison.

# Analysis and Visualization
## Outcomes
Starting with a dataset that contained Census data on all college graduates, I sought to explore, across major categories, the outcomes of individuals who had earned college degrees. To do so, I looked at both people who had entered the workforce and people who had continued their studies at the graduate level. 

First, career outcomes. Let's begin with a graph of the median incomes of all college graduates (US$) with year-round, full time employment:

![median income all ages]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/median-income-all-ages.png)

Compare this to a similar plot that contains data for only recent college graduates:

![median income recent grads]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/median-income-recent-grads.png)

In every field, the aggregate of all college graduates had higher median incomes than the subset of only recent grads. It makes good sense that a set containing individuals who graduated longer ago would have a higher median income--broadly, the members of that set have had more time to advance their careers and earn improved pay. Interestingly, whereas the set of all college grads shows that physical science majors make roughly $10000 more than law and public policy majors, the set of only recent grads shows that those two fields have approximately equal pay. Additionally, the difference between all grads' and recent grads' income in physical science is ~ $20000, while the same difference for law and public policy grads is ~ $10000. This speaks to the demand for STEM concentrators and the static, hierarchical nature of law: while the technology sector is reaching new heights (which also explains the high earnings of engineers), it is becoming increasingly difficult for young lawyers to become partnered--where the real money in law is. A similar trend emerges if one compares computers & mathematics grads to business grads.

Another important metric of career outcomes is unemployment rates. I again broke the information down by major category, beginning with the set of all college graduates:

![unemployment all ages]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/unemployment-all-ages.png)

And for recent grads only:

![unemployment recent grads]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/unemployment-recent-grads.png)

In every field, recent college grads have higher unemployment levels than those of the all-college-graduates dataset. In the pre-pandemic world (when this data was collected), American unemployment was reaching new lows. In an environment of high job demand and low supply, younger graduates, who have less if not no career experience, are likely going to be less attractive candidates than individuals who have been out of college and in the real world for several years.

Second, I also wanted to investigate graduate school outcomes by visualizing the fields in which grad students had concentrated when in college:

![degrees grad students]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/degrees-grad-students.png)

**ANALYSIS GOES HERE** something about certain fields requiring more time in school. perhaps how that isn't the case for business and others

Social science is a particularly interesting case: it has both high unemployment and a large share of the graduate-student population. As the vast majority of social work is restricted to individuals with higher degrees, it stands to reason that people who

## Women in Higher Education 
Historically, women have had far worse access to higher education than have men. Even in the modern day, when American universities admit similar numbers of men and women each year, women still face systemic pressures to pursue certain disciplines over others. I wanted to visualize the paths that women choose to take and started by surveying recent college graduates:

![degrees of recent man and woman grads]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/men-women-recent-grads.png)

To save you some division, here's a graph that shows the share of women in each field:

![share women recent grads]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/share-women-recent-grads.png)

**ANALYSIS GOES HERE**

And, focusing specifically on women in STEM, this graph shows the distribution of recent woman graduates in the five categories marked by FiveThirtyEight as STEM fields:

![women stem recent grads]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/women-stem-recent-grads.png)

**ANALYSIS GOES HERE** Together, "Biology & Life Science" and "Health" comprise 68% of all degrees granted to women pursuing STEM majors, while "Computers & Mathematics" and "Physical Sciences" each account for roughly 9%.

# it would be better to format this as a narrative about exploring the article

1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?

The alternative hypothesis stated that "nicotine e-cigarettes would be more effective than patches and placebo e-cigarettes for smoking reduction, tobacco dependence, and relief of withdrawal symptoms, and that they would have no greater risk of adverse events than nicotine patches."

The null hypothesis stated that e-cigarettes were no more effective than nicotine patches or placebo e-cigarettes at achieveing any of the aforementioned objectives.

3. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?

At least one researcher belonged to one of the following institutions: the National Institute for Health Innovation in University of Auckland's School of Population Health; Health New Zealand, a company run by one of the researchers; the Wolfson Institute of Preventative Medicine in the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies at Queen Mary University of London; and the Department of Public Health and General Practice at the University of Otago. The researchers declared that they received no funding or other types of support from any relevant companies, such as cigarette sellers, although Health New Zealand once consulted for an e-cigarette copmany in the past. A number of researchers had formerly received honoraria for speaking at meetings for smoking-cessation drugs.

4. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?

To sort the participants into nicotine-containing e-cigarette, nicotine patch, and placebo e-cigarette cohorts, the researchers used computerized block randomization, a tool that, according to stastician Martin Bland, "reduces opportunities for bias and confounding in experimental designs, and leads to treatment groups which are random samples of the population sampled, thus helping to meet assumptions of subsequent statistical analysis" (Bland, 2000). Additionally, the study's data collectors received no information about a given participant's treatment regimen. As a result, data was collected in a manner that minimized unconscious biases--that is, a desire to produce significant results--as much as possible. Furthermore, the cartriges given to participants in the e-cigarette groups were masked so that the presence of nicotine was unknown to the user.

The study generated its own datasets from participant questionnaires and examinations. While the final paper includes tables and figures that summarize the data, I could not find the raw datasets online. This may be due to laws that mandate the protection of participants' identities. 

5. Why are they interested in this data?

Smoking is a leading cause of lung cancer, which kills over one million people annually. Consequently, smoking cessation presents a promising avenue by which worldwide lung cancer rates can be reduced. With that in mind, the researchers were interested in determining whether nicotine-containing e-cigarettes helped smokers to quit with a greater efficacy than did nicotine patches, which, if confirmed, could fundamentally alter the paradigm of lung-cancer prevention. 

6. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?

The researchers recorded at seven-day intervals whether participants had relapsed. What such a simple (not that simplicity is not always a bad thing) and standardized metric does, however, is reduce the complexity of the participants. It cannot possibly take into account the vicissitudes of the human existence; when these inevitable stresses of life are obscured in a trial that includes people at high risk of relapse, we lose critical explanatory datapoints that could produce an erroneous conclusion. Additionally, a consequence of the questionnaire-driven nature of the study was that, self-reporting rates, by the researchers' admission, varied, leading to not-entirely comparable results across cohorts.

7. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?

The researchers found that the achievement of abstinence was significantly lower than anticipated across all cohorts, leading them to be unable to confirm the alternative hypothesis. They observed that many participants quit smoking in the initial days of the study but soon relapsed. Despite its statistical insignificance, it may be worth noting that, among those who relapsed, the nicotine e-cigarette group had a median time to relapse that was over double that of the nicotine patch and placebo e-cigarette groups. Additionally, they did find that the amount by which nicotine e-cigarette users reduced their daily cigarette intake was significantly higher than that of placebo e-cigarette users.

8. How was this study funded?

This study was funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand, a government agency that manages the government's investment in medical research. As the researchers state in the paper, "The sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full
access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication."

9. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

Although one could argue that the publish-or-perish mentality pervades all current scientific research, this study appears minimally susceptible to it, if at all. Most importantly, the study confirms its null hypothesis. While the researchers likely would have attracted more attention (and citations) had they modified the data to suggest that e-cigarettes are an effective aid for smokers seeking to quit, they did no such thing. And, for the record, the paper was nevertheless received well by the scientific community and, at present, has been cited over a thousand times.

# Designing Studies

## Review
1. What is the difference between a sample and a population?

   A population is the group of interest--the group about which you are trying to pose a hypothesis/create a conclusion. The population can comprise more groups than the sample represents. The sample is usually a subset of the population. For example if you're trying to study Arctic animals, your sample may be penguins only but then we extrapolate results back out to all Arctic animals, such as polar bears etc.

## Types of Studies
1. What is the difference between an **observational** and an **experimental** study?

   In an observational study, we measure or survey members of a sample without trying to affect them. In an experiment, we assign people or things to groups and apply some treatment to one of the groups, while the other group does not receive the treatment. 
   Example of an observational study: we collect data on student stress levels and the number of classes they take and then try to find correlation between the two. Experimental study example: randomized control studies.

3. What is meant by the phrase "correlation, not causation"? Take a look at [Tyler Vigen's spurious correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) for some examples.

   The phrase "correlation, not causation" refers to the inability to legitimately deduce a causal relationship between two events or variables solely on the basis of an observed association or correlation between them. This can be caused by confounding variables: for example, shark attacks and ice cream consumption are correlated, but in reality it's because people have a higher likelihood of eating ice cream when they are at the beach, which is where sharks are.

5. Why can't an observational study show causation?

   An observational study documents what occurs without external interference, so we cannot confirm that changes in one factor change another. 

7. What reasons might a researcher have for choosing one type of study over another?

   Experimental studies are vastly more expensive, regulation-laden, and slower than observational studies. Observational studies can suggest viable paths for future experimental studies. Correlative data can also be collected faster; in the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, we can't wait around to perform rigorous experimental studies and need the data in real time, and huge sample sets can help with the correlation.

## Sample Frame
1. What is a **sample frame**, and how is that different from a sample?

   The sample frame is the group from which we obtain our samples. The sample frame is generally a proper subset of the population (meaning that it is smaller than the population) beacuse it includes only those members of the population who could end up in our sample.

3. What does **coverage bias** (also called **exclusion bias**) mean in the context of choosing a sample frame?

   Coverage error is a bias in a statistic that occurs when the target population does not coincide with the population actually sampled.

5. Suppose a researcher were studying the population of all students at Horace Mann.
   1. Give an example of a sample frame that demonstrates coverage bias.

      Interviewing all students who pass through Tillinghast's basement to learn about the CS department.

   3. What reasons might the researcher have for choosing that sample frame?

      All CS classes are in the basement.

   5. What could the researcher do to reduce coverage bias?

      Pull only from CS classes--that way you get only CS kids.

## Sampling Methodology
1. What does it mean for a sample to be "good"?

   A good sample should be a representative subset of the population we are interested in studying.

2. What is the difference between **probability** and **nonprobability** sampling?

   Probability sampling means that every member of the target population has a known chance of being included in the sample. It aims to reduce coverage bias. In non-probability sampling, the sample is selected based on non-random criteria, and not every member of the population has a chance of being included.

3. Give two examples of nonprobability sampling. What biases might these methods be prone to?

   - Ask students who hang out in the shop whether they like engineering/robotics. This experimental design selects for engineering/robotics kids.
   - The researcher chooses the sample based on who they think would be appropriate for the study. This is used primarily when there is a limited number of people that have expertise in the area being researched, or when the interest of the research is on a specific field or a small group. This lends itself to non-representative sample sets.

4. Give two examples of probability sampling. What biases might these methods be prone to?

   - Survey random students on whether they like English class. Find 100 random students by choosing 100 random names from all UD students. This does not account for other circumstances, such as grade level. A 9th grader who hates English may come around by 12th grade.
   - Go to Times Square and ask random passersby about their thoughts on Eric Adams. There will be more Democrats in Manhattan than Staten Island, so this won't represent all of NYC.
   - Probability sampling cannot exist in reality.

## Practice
Choose one of the following situations:
  - A 3rd grade teacher is interested in childhood literacy development. Theyâ€™ve noticed that some students tend to perform better when asked to do reading tasks. The teacher is curious about what reading activities these students are doing at home.
  - An outdoor enthusiast recently went hiking, and found that some blueberries on the side of the trail were extremely sweet. However, other bushes on the same trail produced tasteless blueberries. The hiker is intrigued by what could be causing this difference.
  - An independent publisher is looking at printing presses to partner with. They are focused on newspapers and want to find a company that is experienced with newsprint paper. The publisher is thinking about what qualities to look for.

Then, for your chosen situation, write a response to the following:
1. Identify a statistical question you could ask in that situation.

   Does increased time spent reading at home improve reading-task performance among 3rd graders in the class?

2. Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?

   3rd graders in NYC whose first language is English. 

3. Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.

   The 3rd grade class that we teach.

4. Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?

   I would retrieve data from a set number of 3rd graders at every public school in the city. Within each school the selected students would be random. This is better than simple random sampling because such a method could inadvertently choose predominantly students from the UES and UWS, which is a generally wealthy subset that does not represent most of the city's population.

5. What biases may come up, and how would you address them?

   Although this method makes sure to draw from students across the city, it fails to take into account socioeconomic differences, which have a massive effect on child development, particularly time spent reading (often with parents) at home.

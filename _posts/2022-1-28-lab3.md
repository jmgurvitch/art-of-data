Hello there! Lab 3 (the data description lab) is an exercise in using pandas and seaborn to process, describe, and visualize data.

## The Datasets
After speaking with Feingold, they were kind enough to send me a Kaggle-hosted package of datasets compiled by FiveThirtyEight that underpins their story [The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/). (The data was originally collected by the U.S. Census Bureau.) As someone who spends quite a lot of time in the education sector myself, I was interested to examine various distributions of college majors and their outcomes. 

As it relates to data processing, the datasets all contain the same 173 majors. Those majors are, usefully, sorted into 16 categories. For example, "chemical engineering" and "nuclear engineering" both fall into the broader category of "engineering." This proved especially useful for visualization; in a bar graph, for example, it is vastly more readable to have 16 aggregate bars versus 173 individual bars.

Hello there! Below I have detailed the splendid journey that was my completion of the Digimon lab.

## Question 1
**What is the average speed (Spd) of all Digimon?**

Having just finished a practice lab on nested dictionaries (the penguins one), I began the lab with the expectation that nested dictionaries would be central to every question. I thus tried to approach question 1 with nested dictionaries, which is a viable strategy. However, as I thought more about the question I realized that it could be solved much more simply (Occam's razor strikes again) by iterating through the dataset, summing the Digimon's speeds, and dividing that sum by the number of Digimon in the dataset to find the average speed. Here's the final method, where `filePath` is the Digimon dataset.
```py
def avgSpd(filePath):
    with open(filePath, "r") as f:
        data = csv.DictReader(f)

        totalSpd = 0
        digimonCount = 0

        #find the sum of all digimon's speeds and the total # of digimon
        for row in data:
            totalSpd += int(row["Spd"]) 
            digimonCount += 1 

        #find avg speed
        avgSpd = totalSpd / digimonCount
        return "Average speed: " + str(avgSpd)
```


## Question 2
**Write a function that can count the number of Digimon with a specific attribute. For example, count_digimon("Type", "Vaccine") would return 70.**


## Question 3
**The Digimon on your team are restricted by the total amount of Memory that they need. If your team only has 15 Memory, name a team of up to 3 Digimon that has at least 300 attack (Atk) in total.**


Here's a useless table:

| Number | Next number | Previous number |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.

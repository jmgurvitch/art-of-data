Hello there! Lab 3 (the data description lab) is an exercise in using pandas and seaborn to process, describe, and visualize data.

## The Datasets
After speaking with Feingold, they were kind enough to send me a Kaggle-hosted package of datasets compiled by FiveThirtyEight that underpins their story [The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/). (The data was originally collected by the U.S. Census Bureau.) As someone who spends quite a lot of time in the education sector myself, I was interested to examine various distributions of college majors and their outcomes. 

As it relates to data processing, the datasets all contain the same 173 majors. Those majors are, usefully, sorted into 16 categories. For example, "chemical engineering" and "nuclear engineering" both fall into the broader category of "engineering." This proved especially useful for visualization; in a bar graph, for example, it is vastly more readable to have 16 aggregate bars versus 173 individual bars.

## Analysis and Visualization
# Outcomes
Starting with a dataset that contained Census data on all college graduates, I sought to explore, across major categories, the outcomes of individuals who had earned college degrees. To do so, I looked at both people who had entered the workforce and people who had continued their studies at the graduate level. First, let's begin with a graph of the median incomes of all college graduates with year-round, full time employment:

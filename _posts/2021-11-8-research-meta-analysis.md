# it would be better to format this as a narrative about exploring the article

1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?

The alternative hypothesis stated that "nicotine e-cigarettes would be more effective than patches and placebo e-cigarettes for smoking reduction, tobacco dependence, and relief of withdrawal symptoms, and that they would have no greater risk of adverse events than nicotine patches."

The null hypothesis stated that e-cigarettes were no more effective than nicotine patches or placebo e-cigarettes at achieveing any of the aforementioned objectives.

3. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?

At least one researcher belonged to one of the following institutions: the National Institute for Health Innovation in University of Auckland's School of Population Health; Health New Zealand, a company run by one of the researchers; the Wolfson Institute of Preventative Medicine in the UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies at Queen Mary University of London; and the Department of Public Health and General Practice at the University of Otago. The researchers declared that they received no funding or other types of support from any relevant companies, such as cigarette sellers, although Health New Zealand once consulted for an e-cigarette copmany in the past. A number of researchers had formerly received honoraria for speaking at meetings for smoking-cessation drugs.

4. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?

To sort the participants into nicotine-containing e-cigarette, nicotine patch, and placebo e-cigarette cohorts, the researchers used computerized block randomization, a tool that, according to stastician Martin Bland, "reduces opportunities for bias and confounding in experimental designs, and leads to treatment groups which are random samples of the population sampled, thus helping to meet assumptions of subsequent statistical analysis" (Bland 2000). Additionally, the study's data collectors received no information about a given participant's treatment regimen. As a result, data was collected in a manner that minimized unconscious biases--a desire to produce significant results--as much as possible.

5. Why are they interested in this data?

Smoking is a leading cause of lung cancer, which kills over one million people annually. Consequently, smoking cessation presents a promising avenue by which worldwide lung cancer rates can be reduced. With that in mind, the researchers were interested in determining whether nicotine-containing e-cigarettes helped smokers to quit with a greater efficacy than did nicotine patches, which, if confirmed, could fundamentally alter the paradigm of lung-cancer prevention. 

6. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?



7. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?



8. How was this study funded?

This study was funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand, a government agency that manages the government's investment in medical research.

9. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

Although one could argue that the publish-or-perish mentality pervades all current scientific research, this study appears minimally susceptible to it, if at all. Most importantly, the study confirms its null hypothesis. While the researchers likely would have attracted more attention (and citations) had they modified the data to suggest that e-cigarettes are an effective aid for smokers seeking to quit, they did no such thing. And, for the record, the paper was nevertheless received well by the scientific community and, at present, has been cited over a thousand times.

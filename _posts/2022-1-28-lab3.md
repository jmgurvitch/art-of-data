Hello there! Lab 3 (the data description lab) is an exercise in using pandas and seaborn to process, describe, and visualize data.

## The datasets
Using Kaggle (and Feingold's wonderful advice), I downloaded a package of datasets compiled by FiveThirtyEight that underpinned their story [The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/). The data was originally collected by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Hello there! Below I have detailed the splendid journey that was Lab 1, the Digimon lab.

## Question 1
**What is the average speed (Spd) of all Digimon?**

Having just finished a practice lab on nested dictionaries (the penguins one), I began the lab with the expectation that nested dictionaries would be central to every question. I thus tried to approach question 1 with nested dictionaries, which is a viable strategy. However, as I thought more about the question I realized that it could be solved much more simply (Occam's razor strikes again) by iterating through the dataset, summing the Digimon's speeds, and dividing that sum by the number of Digimon in the dataset to find the average speed. 

Here's the whole function, where `filePath` is the Digimon dataset's path.
```py
def avgSpd(filePath):
    with open(filePath, "r") as f:
        data = csv.DictReader(f)

        totalSpd = 0
        digimonCount = 0

        #find the sum of all digimon's speeds and the total # of digimon
        for row in data:
            totalSpd += int(row["Spd"]) #int instead of float for elegance (many decimal points with float)
            digimonCount += 1 

        #find avg speed
        avgSpd = totalSpd / digimonCount
        return "Average speed: " + str(avgSpd)
```
This returns the following: `Average speed: 120`.

## Question 2
**Write a function that can count the number of Digimon with a specific attribute. For example, count_digimon("Type", "Vaccine") would return 70.**

Having dispelled my tunnel vision on nested dictionaries over the course of my completing question 1, I approached this question without any such expectation. Consequently, the solution came to me fairly quickly. I used a for loop to iterate through all Digimon and add one to a counter if the Digimon at hand satisfied the desired attribute, which was a string or int in a specified column of the Digimon dataset.

Here's the whole function, where `filePath` is the Digimon dataset's path. In this case, `columnName` is "Type," and `attribute` is "Vaccine":
```py
def attributeCounter(filePath, columnName, attribute): #columnName specifies a column, and attribute specifies a term (string or int) within that column for which we are searching
    with open(filePath, "r") as f:
        data = csv.DictReader(f)

        attributeCount = 0

        #if a digimon has the attribute, add one to counter
        for digimon in data:
            if digimon[columnName] == attribute:
                attributeCount += 1

        return "Number of Digimon whose " + str(columnName) + " is " + str(attribute) + ": " + str(attributeCount)
```
This returns the following: `Number of Digimon whose Type is Vaccine: 70`.

## Question 3
**The Digimon on your team are restricted by the total amount of Memory that they need. If your team only has 15 Memory, name a team of up to 3 Digimon that has at least 300 attack (Atk) in total.**

Initially, I misunderstood this question and thought that I had to find all combinations of Digimon that satisfied the question's parameters. This raised the additional question of whether we were considering ordered or unordered sets (oh, combinatorics...), but fortunately I did not have to address this because I took another look at the question and realized I was answering something completely different. Although it was possible to assemble satisfactory teams of either 2 or 3 Digimon, I decided to focus on the 3-Digimon case, which was acceptable beacuse the question called for us to find just **one** team. 

To cover all possible sets of three Digimon, I used a 3-layer for loop where each layer corresponded to one member of the 3-Digimon team. If any given set of 3 Digimon satisfied the question's parameters, then their names were placed in a list. I also tried to use a nested dictionary (still thinking that I needed to use nested dictionaries as much as possible), but it turned out that a list was easier to manipulate, particularly for the return statement. 

Here's the whole function, where `filePath` is the Digimon dataset's path:
```py
def teamMaker(filePath):
    with open(filePath, "r") as f:
        data = csv.DictReader(f)

        #use nested for loops to run through every combination of 3 digimon until a satisfactory combo is found
        for digimon1 in data:
            for digimon2 in data:
                for digimon3 in data:
                    #components (split lines) of if statement:
                    #all digimon are distinct
                    #memories sum to at most 15
                    #attacks sum to at least 300
                    if digimon1 != digimon2 and digimon2 != digimon3 \
                    and float(digimon1["Memory"]) + float(digimon2["Memory"]) + float(digimon3["Memory"]) <= 15 \
                    and (float(digimon1["Atk"]) + float(digimon2["Atk"]) + float(digimon3["Atk"]) >= 300):
                        team = [digimon1["Digimon"], digimon2["Digimon"], digimon3["Digimon"]] #print only the Digimon's names, not all of their characteristics

        return "Satisfactory team: " + str(team)
```
This returns the following: `Satisfactory team: ['Kuramon', 'Pabumon', 'Tyrannomon']`, whose total memory is 10 and total attack is 303.

# Reflections and notes on the code-writing process
As I have mentioned a couple times above, I walked into this lab with eyes only for nested dictionaries. The humble for loop, let alone lists, never crossed my mind. Over time, however, I realized that any elegant solution to the lab's questions would draw on everything that we had learned. With that, I went through our past modules and picked and chose the relevant components from each. Coding is all about using your metaphorical toolbox to its fullest, and that can only be done, I have learned, when you let yourself use the whole toolbox.

In addition to bouncing ideas off of my classmates while in class every day, I worked on question 3 in particular with Bulyn Panjamapirom, a senior in the G-period section of Art of Data.

Behold, me coding so hard I break the space-time continuum:
